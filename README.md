SlicedBread - Java multithreading made easy
===========================================

SlicedBread is a library that makes it simpler to program multithreaded
applications in Java. It does so by doing away with "classic" multithreaded 
staples - that is, shared state - versus a set of single-thread applications that
send and receive immutable messages. In a sense it is inspired by Erlang's 
messaging system.

It has been used in production systems for quite a bit of time now with no major 
issues, so I thought it was something that could benefit the community at large
and I'm sharing it.
